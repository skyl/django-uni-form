   contain the root `toctree` directive.

django-uni-form (django-uni-form)
=======================================

Django_ forms are easily rendered as tables,
paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
format.

`Uni-form`_ has been selected as the base model for the design of the forms.

**Warning:** django-uni-form 0.8 and higher renders django.form.field labels with the 'safe' filter. If you have user generated form field labels you should take this into consideration.

**Note:** django-uni-form 0.8 and higher lays out the HTML for the uni_form tag differently than previous versions. The errorMsg div is now outside the fieldset as it should be.

**Note:** django-uni-form 0.7 and higher breaks backwards compatibility with previous versions of django-uni-form. All you have to do is update templates that call on the django-uni-form template tag from::

    {% load uni_form %}
    
To::

    {% load uni_form_tags %}
