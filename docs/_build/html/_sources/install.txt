Installing django-uni-form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install into your python path using pip or easy_install::

    pip install django-uni-form
    easy_install django-uni-form    
    
Add *'uni_form'* to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'uni_form',
        )
        
Depending on your setup, you may need to copy the media files to your local 
media folder::

    cp -r <location-of-django-uni-form>/uni_form/media/uni_form <directory-for-my-project's-media-files>
    
Displaying the media files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure you're linking to a copy of jQuery.  It's recommended that you use the version hosted on Google's servers since the user's browser might already have it cached.  (You can get the url for the latest version of jQuery at http://scriptsrc.net/.)  But there are some cases in which you'll want to host jQuery yourself, such as if you're doing development offline::

    <script src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}js/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Beyond jQuery, django-uni-form requires three media files.  You can see how we call them by looking in the templates/includes.html file. You can call those files in several ways.

1. The best way is probably to copy this HTML into your templates. This allows you to make use of the CSS compressors that have been created by the Django community (http://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/asset-managers/). Here's the HTML::

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ MEDIA_URL }}uni_form/uni-form.css" type="text/css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ MEDIA_URL }}uni_form/default.uni-form.css" type="text/css" />
    <!-- note that there's also blue.uni-form.css and dark.uni-form.css available if you want to try changing defaults up -->
    <script src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}uni_form/uni-form.jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

2. Another way is to use Django's built-in **includes** template tag::

    {% include "uni_form/includes.html" %}
    
3. A third way is to use the django-uni-form **uni_form_setup** template tag.  Note that you'll need some additional setup for this::

    {% uni_form_setup %}

If you want to take advantage of the uni_form_setup tag, then you'll need to make sure '*django.core.context_processors.request*' is in the  TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS tuple in your settings.py file::

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'django.core.context_processors.request',
        )
